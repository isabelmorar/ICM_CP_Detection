# Inductive Conformal Martingales for Change-Point Detection

This repository contains the code and results from the project on implementing and validating a non-parametric change-point detection method based on **Inductive Conformal Martingales (ICMs)**. The goal is to replicate the theoretical results, evaluate the method's performance, and enhance reproducibility through an open-source implementation.
