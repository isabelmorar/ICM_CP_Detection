# Inductive Conformal Martingales for Change-Point Detection

This repository contains the code and results from the project on implementing and validating a non-parametric change-point detection method based on **Inductive Conformal Martingales (ICMs)**. The goal is to replicate the theoretical results, evaluate the method's performance, and enhance reproducibility through an open-source implementation.

This repository includes files with the necessary functions to implement the main ICM algorithm, several non-conformity measures, betting functions, and validation experiments. The implementation focuses on detecting change points in synthetic time series data, but the overall goal of the project is to assess the effectiveness of the ICM algorithm for future application on hydroclimatic data.

A detailed explanation of the methodology, experimental setup, and results can be found in the complete report available as a .pdf document.
